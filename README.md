# breast_cancer_detection

# Overview

The risk of developing breast cancer is continouslly emmerging.The early detection of it in the patient can surrelly increase the survival rate.

In this project I am to develop a machine learning model that can be used to which could classify tumours present in a patient that could eventually result in breast cancer.

Values present in the dataset includes tumor radius which is mainly the distances from center to points on the perimeter,texture as in standard deviation of gray-scale values, perimeter, area, smoothness indicating the local variation in radius lengths, compactness i.e perimeter² / area — 1.0, concavity as in severity of concave portions of the contour, concave points or number of concave portions of the contour, symmetry and fractal dimension.
